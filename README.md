### Welcome to parse_trimming_reports.py

This program has been designed to parse the output reports from trim_galore! into table format.
At this point it only works with single-read trimmed data, but I plan to update the
script once I have a minute to try it on paired-end data.

Example usage: `./parse_trimming_reports.py -r *trimming_report.txt -o trim_galore_combined_report.csv`


optional arguments:

  -h, --help            show this help message and exit

  -r REPORT_FILES [REPORT_FILES ...], --report_files REPORT_FILES [REPORT_FILES ...]

                        This is an optional way to use the command line to list the report files
                        generated by trim_galore. The other option is to use the --text (-t) option
                        to specify a text file that lists the report files. These files typically
                        end in '_trimming_report.txt'.

  -o OUTPUT_FILE, --output_file OUTPUT_FILE

                        This is the name of the output csv file containing relevant information
                        from the trimming report files generated by trim_galore! Default file is
                        'trim_galore_combined_report.csv'
